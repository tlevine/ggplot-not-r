How I think about plotting data
================================
Have you seen plots of data that are ridiculously explanatory and you
can't understand why? Do you want to plot data and have no idea what sort
of plot to use? Or do you want to distinguish between plots that are
informative and plots that are simply flashy?

## Principles
Here are two principles that I hope to convey. They might not make sense
at the moment, but try to keep them in mind as you read the rest of this
article.

### 1. Plotting is how we perceive abstract data
I define "plotting" thusly.

> Plotting is the process of mapping abstract data to concrete
> things that we can perceive.

Data are abstract and do not have a fundamental representation in the real
world. We map abstract data onto concrete things in the real world so that
we can undersand the abstract data. **In order to make good plots, we have
to choose mappings that people understand**.

Some people think of data tables and histograms (for example) as pure, true
representations of data. I don't. These are simple plots and may be easier
to understand than complex plots, but they still involve deciding how to
represent abstract data as concrete things that we can perceive.

### 2. Escape flatland
Plots are more informative when they relate/compare several things.
**An enthralling plot relates several variables without being distracting**.
I pay lots of attention to how many different variables I am representing
in one plot, and I always try to add more. I look for interactions in plots
the same way that I look for interactions in statistical models.

I've prepared a toy project and some videos and some readings.
I hope that these will give you some understanding of plotting.
They might also teach you something about ggplot2 and R, but
focus more on understanding plotting.

## Read these slides
While I have a particular way of thinking about plotting, I haven't
really written it up anywhere; the closest thing to that is
[these slides](http://dada.pink/gastronomification-big-data-talk/hacks-hackers-berlin-2014-08/data-visualization-needs-to-die.pdf), which I would
like you to read. They were part of a talk that wasn't recorded, so
don't expect to understand it all. 

The main thing that you should pay attention to, for now, is how
abstract data can be mapped to things other than graphics, per my
definition of "plotting".

The other thing you might pay attention to is the value of representing
many different variables at once.

## Watch this video
I haven't written much about how I think about plotting, so I can't
give you much more that I have written. On the other hand, many people
have inspired this way of thinking, so maybe you can just read their
writings and watch their videos.

My definition of plotting is based largely on ggplot2 and the Grammar
of Graphics, by Hadley Wickham and Leland Wilkinson, respectively.
My insistance on representing many dimensions comes largely from
Edward Tufte and from experiment design theory. And my views on making
graphics that are visually interesting, coherent, and generally "good"
come largely from Edward Tufte and Timothy Samara.

I'll give you many references later. For now, just watch
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaxJwC_MP9Q)
until you get bored. Alternatively, you can read through
[these slides](http://ggplot2.org/resources/2007-vanderbilt.pdf).

## Set up your computer
Now let's also see if you can learn a bit about ggplot2 without learning R.
(Well, actually, I already know that you totally can.)

I do assume, however, that you have installed R, you can open it. And
it would be nice if you could write simple SQL, but it's probably fine
if you don't.

You might choose to download all of the files that you need with either
of the following commands

    # Option 1
    git clone git@github.com:tlevine/ggplot-not-r

    # Option 2
    wget --recursive --level=2 http://dada.pink/ggplot-not-r/

But you don't need to do either of those, as all of the files are linked
from the present webpage.

## Toy project
Start out by changing the contents of the `aes` function call and by
adding geoms other than `geom_point`. Here are some aesthetics (`aes`)
that you might try.

* `x`
* `y`
* `group`
* `label`
* `color`
* `fill`

And here are some geoms you might try.

* `geom_point`
* `geom_text`
* `geom_line`
* `geom_path`
* `geom_bar`

You can look at the
[ggplot2 documuentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/),
but ignore the parts that you don't understand.

Don't worry about making particularly pretty plots; just try to make plots
that tell you something.

## When you get bored
Here are a few directions you can go when you get tired of the above
toy project.

### Use your own data
If I were you, I'd probably just want to start playing with my own data.
Figure out how to load you data into R, and then start plotting it.

### More about the Grammar of Graphics
Once you start seeing plots as mappings between abstract data and concrete
elements, different plots start seeming much more similar. Look at a few
plots, such as [these](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), and deconstruct
them into their grammatical components. Answer at least these questions
about each plot.

* What variables are represented?
* What real-world element is each abstract variable mapped to?

If you would like to delve deeper, try these questions.

* What is the coordinate system?
* What happens when two data points collide on the plot?
* What are the scales for the different variables?
* How are the data transformed before they are plotted? That is, what
    mathematical operations were applied?

Alternatively, just answer the following question:
**How would you write this plot in ggplot2?**

### Make your graphs look better.
In general, if you want to make something interesting, follow most of
the rules and then break one or two.

You can read *Design Elements*, by Timothy Samara, or you can just read
this [summary](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Book-Layout-Timothy-Samaras-20-Rules-of-Good-Design/7616553)
of the rules.
Then try appling these design elements to your plots.

There are some special rules for visual displays of quantitative information.
You can read about them in any of Edward Tufte's books, such as
*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Here are two main concepts
to try to understand

* Escaping Flatland (presenting multivariate data)
* Data:ink ratio

### Learn more R
Here are some materials for learning R.

* [R Spells for Data Wizards](http://thomaslevine.com/!/r-spells-for-data-wizards/)
* [Intro to R](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP) videos
* [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)
* [R is for wizards](http://www.matthewckeller.com/Lecture1.ppt)

### Read more
I tried to keep it short so that you could get on with the toy project,
so I left out the following materials, which are also great.

* *Visualizing Data*, by William Cleveland, has many fine examples of different
ways to represent datasets with one variable and two variables.
* [Here](http://ggplot2.org/resources/2007-past-present-future.pdf)
are some more slides about ggplot2.
* The *Grammar of Graphics*, by Leland Wilkinson, is obviously relevant.
    See the notes in the appendix about reading it and about its terminology.

## More on learning
I'm curious to see whether this article made any sense or was helpful or
anything. Also, here's a bit about my
[views on learning](http://thomaslevine.com/!/tom-computer-school/).

### Reading the Grammar of Graphics
I disliked the order in which the Grammar of Graphics was presented;
consider reading it in the order of
[this outline](grammar-of-graphics-outline.mdwn).

### Grammar of Graphics versus ggplot2
The Grammar of Graphics breaks things up into six command types.
They have different names in ggplot, so here are the translations.

1. The dataset is specified with a `DATA` command in the Grammar of
    Graphics and with `ggplot` in ggplot2.
2. Variables might need to be manipulated before plotting. This is
    specified with a `TRANS` command in the Grammar of Graphics or
    with normal R code in ggplot2
3. We can have linear scales, a logarithmic scales, a date scales,
    and so on. This is specified with a `SCALE` command in the
    Grammar of Graphics or with a `scale_` command in ggplot2
    (like `scale_size_discrete`).
4. We often use a Cartesian coordinates system, but there are so
    many others. These are `COORD` commands in the Grammar of Graphics,
    and they are prefixed with `coord_` in ggplot2.
5. Axes and other annotations are called `GUIDE` in the Grammar of
    Graphics and have many manifestations in ggplot2.
6. Elements/geometries are the concrete things that represent the
    data; they're `ELEMENT` commands in the Grammar of Graphics and
    `geom_` commands in ggplot2.

### Some plots Tom made
Here are some plots that I didn't spend much time on but am reasonably
proud of, with links to the articles that I took them from.
